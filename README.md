# Apple-Watch-Haptic-Metronome
A metronome application for WatchOS 10.5 that uses haptic feedback to keep musicians in time

## Features

This is a very limited metronome app, but it fills a niche that is currently empty as no free haptic metronome exists for WatchOS

- BPMs between 30 and 240 are supported by the app
- Background modes are enabled to allow metronome clicks to persist through watch sleep
- BPM can be adjusted quickly by + or - 5, or entered manually in a sub-menu
